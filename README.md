DUnitX Overview
===============

DUnitX is a new test framework, taking ideas from DUnit, NUnit and other test frameworks. It is designed to work with Delphi 2010 or later, it makes use of language/RTL features that are not available in older versions of Delphi.


DUnitX Features
===============

 * Any class can contain tests
 * Attribute based testing
 * An extensive Assert Class
 * Setup and TearDown per test method and per test fixture.
 * API Documented using Xml-Doc
 * Console Based Runner
 * XML Logging
   * produces output compatible with NUnit (compatible with CI servers like [ContinuaCI](https://www.finalbuilder.com/continua-ci))
   * produces output compatible with JUnit (compatible with [Gitlab CI](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/unit_test_reports.html))
 * Cross platform currently supporting:
    * Win32,Win64 and OSX Compilers.
 * Limited backwards compatibility with DUnit test classes. 
 * [Wizard](https://www.finalbuilder.com/Resources/Blogs/dunitx-has-a-wizard) for creating new tests.

DUnitX Planned Features
=======================

This is far from a complete list, but a few planned features are listed here to help indicate future direction.

 * ~~GUI Test Runner~~ - Use [TestInsight](https://bitbucket.org/sglienke/testinsight/wiki/Home)
 * Multi-threaded tests - the ability to have test fixtures run in their own
  threads.
 * Remote logging - Simple way to run tests on remote machines (just an idea at this point) 
 * Data driven test cases - the ability to provide a test method with a data source and test each entry in the data source. The data source will be virtualised so it can be anything (text file, db table etc).

Tips and Tricks
===========
* In order to workaround the [Delphi XE3 Bug](https://github.com/VSoftTechnologies/DUnitX/issues/117), you need to add the unit DUnitX.Init to your test projects.
* To use this GitHub version of DUnitX in place of the bundled version included with RAD Studio, itâ€™s pretty simple by following these steps (as the bundled version is quite a few commits behind this repo):
  - Remove the Embarcadero Unit test package (DUnitXIDEExpertXXX.bpl) from the installed packages list.
  - In the cloned repo, open DUnitX_IDE_Expert_XXXX.dproj (matching your Delphi version), compile and install the package.
  - In your unit test projects, adjust your search paths to point to the repo\Source folder.


Support

A [Delphi Praxis Forum](https://en.delphipraxis.net/forum/36-dunitx/) has been setup to discuss DUnitX.
